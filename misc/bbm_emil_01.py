Thrilling Teleporters allows players to randomize the teleporters each game. However, during development they found that sometimes this can lead to boards where a player cannot get to the end of the board. We want to figure out if this has happened.

You'll be given the following inputs:
- A collection of teleporter strings
- The number of sides on the die
- The square the player starts on
- The last square on the board

Write a function that returns whether or not it is possible to get to the last square from the starting square in any number of turns.

Examples:
teleporters1 = ["10,8", "11,5", "12,7", "13,9"]
               +------------------+
               |        +-----+   |
               v        v     |   |
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20
                     ^     ^          |   |
                     +-----|----------+   |
                           +--------------+

With a 4 sided die, starting at square 0 with a board ending at square 20 (as pictured above)
No matter what you roll, it's not possible to get past the teleporters from 10-13.
finishable(teleporters1, 4, 0, 20) => False

If an additional teleporter was added from square 2 to square 15, this would be possible to finish.
teleporters2 = ["10,8", "11,5", "12,7", "13,9", "2,15"]
finishable(teleporters2, 4, 0, 20) => True

But if we started on square 9, then it is still impossible as square 20 cannot be reached.
finishable(teleporters2, 4, 9, 20) => False

Additional Input:
teleporters3 = ["10,8", "11,5", "12,1", "13,9", "2,15"]
teleporters4 = ["2,4", "9,8", "11,7", "12,6", "18,14",
                "19,16", "20,9", "21,14", "22,6", "23,26",
                "25,10", "28,19", "29,27", "31,29", "38,33",
                "39,17", "41,30", "42,28", "45,44", "46,36"]
teleporters5 = ["4,21", "11,18", "13,17", "16,17", "18,21",
                "22,11", "26,25", "27,9", "31,38", "32,43",
                "34,19", "35,19", "36,39", "38,25", "41,31"]

Complexity variable:
B = size of the board
Note: The number of teleporters, T, and the size of the die, D, are bounded by B.

All Test Cases:
                        die, start, end
